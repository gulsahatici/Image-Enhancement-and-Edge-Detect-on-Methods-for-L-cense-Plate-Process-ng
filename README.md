# Image-Enhancement-and-Edge-Detect-on-Methods-for-L-cense-Plate-Process-ng
A classical image processing project for "BASIC METHODS AND PRINCIPLES IN IMAGE PROCESSING" course. This project implements plate localization by benchmarking pipelines like LoG, Gaussian-Sobel, and Gaussian-Canny with geometric filtering and success rate analysis, strictly avoiding AI models.
